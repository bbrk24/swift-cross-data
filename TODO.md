- Decide on a license (BSD-like or MPL?)
- Support migrations
  - I have no idea how they work in CoreData
- Indexes
- `JOIN`
  - will likely require splitting up the current `select` method into a chain of multiple methods
- Foreign keys
  - technically orthogonal to the previous point, even if they're usually used together
  - blocked by indexes since SQLite requires the referenced column to be `UNIQUE` and not `rowid`
